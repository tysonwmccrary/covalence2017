# Lab 09b - Shape Up or Shape Out (TypeScript)
* Re-do lab 08 (Shape Up or Shape Out) using TypeScript and LESS
* Include a .gitignore file so that you do not commit your .css and .js files
* You should use TypeScript classes, inheritance, the let keyword, function parameter types, etc.
* In LESS, take advantage of variables and nesting as you see fit.
