# Lab 09a - Dicey Business (TypeScript)
* Re-do lab 07 (Dicey Business) using TypeScript and LESS
* Include a .gitignore file so that you do not commit your .css and .js files
* You should use a TypeScript class, the let keyword, function parameter types, etc.
* In LESS, take advantage of variables and nesting as you see fit
